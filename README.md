This is the repo for Dilemma, a quiz application developed by us with The Hague University and De Haga Ziekenhuis. The goal of the application was to raise awareness about cybersecurity for hospital workers. The application includes a set of multiple-choice questions that health care and cyber-security related topics. When the user finishes, they  receive a score and a summary of their results.
